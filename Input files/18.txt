A video of a Russian YouTuber burning his Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S in the middle of an empty field is going viral online. Well, you are not alone, netizens were also left stunned after watching the clip. The video that is going viral on YouTube shows the Russian YouTuber Mikhail Litvin, also known as Misha, burning down his luxury car worth Rs 2.42 crore (in India). He was frustrated with the company (Mercedes) after facing several issues with the car. Finally, when his problems weren't solved, even after trying several times, he thought the best solution would be to burn down his car. The car currently starts at 12,720,000 (ex-showroom) Russian Ruble (Rs 1,19,90,363).
He shared the video of himself burning the car with gasoline, in the middle of a field, with the caption, "I thought for a long time what to do with my Shark after the conflict with Mercedes.In my opinion, the idea is FIRE! I'm not happy (sic)."
In the clip, he doused his vehicle with gasoline, set it on fire with a lighter, and then leaves in another car.
His Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S reportedly broke down several times after Misha purchased it from an official dealership in 2019. According to a local website VC.ru, the YouTuber sent it back to a Mercedes dealer five times. However, every single time, the repairs that the company performed, were not successful. The car spent more than 40 days in a workshop. During one of the service sessions, the turbine was also replaced with a new one, which was ordered from Germany. However, when the car broke down again, the dealership stopped answering the YouTuber's calls, and that is when he decided to end it.
The shocking footage managed to go insanely viral and within a few days has garnered more than 11 million views. Netizens took to the comments section to express their shock over the whole incident.
