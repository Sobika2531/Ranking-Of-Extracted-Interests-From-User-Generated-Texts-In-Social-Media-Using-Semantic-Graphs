Kanittha Thongnak, an online retailer from Thailand's Phetchabun, made headlines after she dressed up as a zombie to sell clothes of dead people in sales streamed live on social media. Her online audience increased ever since she started appearing as a zombie in front of her customers virtually.
Kanittha Thongnak, 32, wears scary make-up and takes around three hours to complete her zombie look, Reuters reports. She hosts her online sessions late at night during which she tells buyers exactly how the owners of each item died.
"All the clothes belong to dead people who died from different causes. Since I started to wear scary make-up, the audience increased to five or six thousand," Kanittha told Reuters.
Kanittha Thongnak sells items including branded stuff at relatively low prices for anything up to 100 baht ($3.2). Not to forget, the zombie presentation also intrigues people.
She first got the idea while attending a funeral, where she saw clothes of the deceased burned, in accordance with tradition, Reuters reports.
Kanittha sources the clothing from funeral directors after monks give prayers for the dead. In fact, she also donates part of her income from the sales to Buddhist temples.
"I bought the clothes before, including the one I'm wearing now," Anu Kaewsom, one of Kanittha's customers, told Reuters. "It's like normal clothes," she added.
Apart from clothes, Kanittha also sells handmade scary-themed items, including zombie dolls.
