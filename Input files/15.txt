A video showing the widespread destruction that was caused in Turkey after a strong earthquake struck the Aegean Sea on Friday and triggered a mini-tsunami has surfaced on the internet. Buildings crashed down as tidal waves slammed into coastal areas and islands.
An earthquake struck with a magnitude of up to 7.0 in the Aegean Sea on Friday that had a cataclysmic effect on Turkey and Greece, and especially in the Turkish city of Izmir. People ran here and there in panic. Located on Turkey's Aegean coast, Izmir is the country's third-largest city.
Ragip Soylu, Turkish journalist, tweeted a video that showed a particular area deluged with surging seawater in Izmir. Houses were submerged as water flowed through the neighbourhood, carrying furniture and other household items along with it.
"Another tsunami footage from the earthquake in Izmir province of Turkey is really dangerous," Ragip Soylu said in the caption of his post.
Search and rescue operations are underway. Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said that 19 people died and 700 were injured people. On the Greek island of Samos two teenagers, a boy and a girl, were found dead in an area where a wall had collapsed, Reuters reports.
Turkey Urbanisation Minister Murat Kurum said that authorities were setting up tents wih a total capacity of 2,000 people near areas with the highest damage.
