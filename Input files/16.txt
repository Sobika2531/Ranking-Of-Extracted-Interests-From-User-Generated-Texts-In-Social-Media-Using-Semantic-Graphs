2020 has been a 'wild' year for everyone. It has made us believe that anything is possible in this universe. And in case you had any doubts, a Harry Styles fan’s story will make you believe that it is absolutely true.
A few days ago, a fan of the pop singer, named Theadora, shared her wild story on Instagram that has gone crazy viral ever since. Theadora explained how the British singer’s car broke down in front of her house, so her father's friend let him in and asked him to stay for a cup of tea. Sadly, she was not at home when this incident took place, so Harry wrote an adorable note for her and even fed Theodora's fish. If you think it was all a dream, you are absolutely wrong about her.
Ever since Theadora shared her story several of Harry Styles's fan accounts on Twitter have shared pictures of the singer at her house and even the note that he wrote for her.
He wrote the note on his album cover for 2019’s Fine Line.
