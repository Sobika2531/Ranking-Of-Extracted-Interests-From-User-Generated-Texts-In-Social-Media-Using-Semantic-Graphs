The Indian Air Force (IAF), on Friday, carried out a successful test firing of the DRDO-developed air-launched BrahMos supersonic cruise missile from a Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft to target a ship in the Bay of Bengal. The aircraft had taken off from an airbase in Punjab & reached the Bay of Bengal after mid-air refuelling. This is the second such successful test of the missile, government sources were quoted as saying by news agency ANI.
The development is significant as it is the longest range BrahMos strike that was undertaken by the Sukhoi 30 MKI platform. As reported earlier by Times Now, south India got its first Sukhoi-30 MKI squadron in January this year. The integration of the air-launched version of the BrahMos missile with the SU-30MKI fighter has been done fully indigenously by BrahMos Aerospace, HAL and the Air Force, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria had said while inducting the squadron.
With a range of 300 km, the air-launched version of BrahMos has the capability to hit targets at sea or land in all weather conditions. On October 18, the supersonic cruise missile was successfully test-fired from Indian Navy’s indigenously-built stealth destroyer INS Chennai, hitting a target in the Arabian Sea.
On September 30, a BrahMos missile was tested from the integrated test range at Balasore in Odisha. The test may be viewed on the backdrop of a series of missile tests carried out by India in the recent past. The tests also come at a time when India and China have been locked in a bitter standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh.
