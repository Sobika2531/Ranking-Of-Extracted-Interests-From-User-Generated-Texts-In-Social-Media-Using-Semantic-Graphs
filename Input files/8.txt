During his journey to the sea on a ship, a man noticed that a bird was struggling to survive as the tiny bird found itself amidst the deep waters. Immediately, he picked the bird up from the waters, and kept the tiny bird on a counter to dry. He also fed the bird some crackers and chips, and served water so that bird could quench its thirst.
As he approached the shore, the man freed the bird as it flew away. "The world needs more people like this," is the caption of the post. The clip collected several likes and retweets and netizens praised the man for rescuing the bird.
