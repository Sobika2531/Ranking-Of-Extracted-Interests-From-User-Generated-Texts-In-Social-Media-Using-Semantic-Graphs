Maha Ashtami is one of the most important days of Durga Puja. It is the eighth day of Navratri and the second day of Durga Puja. On the eighth day of Navratri Goddess Mahagauri is worshipped. This year, Durga Ashtami is on Saturday, October 24, 2020.
Maha Ashtami puja begins with Mahasnan and Shodashopachar Puja. It is very much similar to Maha Saptami Puja except Prana Pratishtha which is done only once on Maha Saptami. Maha Ashtami is also known as Maha Durga Ashtami.
