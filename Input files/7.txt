A man from Bihar's Bhagalpur got a water tank constructed in the shape of his first car - a Mahindra Scorpio - in an ode to the model of the vehicle that he owns. Intasar Alam bought the Scorpio lately and it is his first car.
In order to flaunt his love for the Scorpio, Intasar Alam installed a water tank on the terrace of his residence in the exact shape of his first car. Local reports suggest that the Scorpio water tank also features the same number plate as that of Intasar's car.
Pictures of the Scorpio water tank went viral on social media.
Intasar's wife gave the idea to install Scorpio water tank. She witnessed something similar in Agra and told her husband about it. Intasar was more than willing to create such a tank at his place as well.
Intasar Alam told regional portals that he asked workers from Agra to visit his residence in Bhagalpur and create the Scorpio water tank. He spent 2.5lakhs.
Scorpio is a product of the Mahindra Group. Chairman Anand Mahindra loved the idea. In a post on Twitter, Anand Mahindra said, "Now that's what I call a Rise story "Scorpio Rising to the Rooftop".We salute his affection for his first car!"
