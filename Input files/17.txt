Joshua Walker, a resident of Perth, is fighting attempts to have his American bulldog "destroyed" after it bit his Tinder date that left her with a serious injury. The 28-year-old man has accepted most of the charges levied by the woman but has opposed the application to have his pet dog Texas "destroyed".
Joshua Walker interacted with the woman on Tinder, and thereafter, met her at a hotel for drinks on Christmas last year. After their outing, the lady went to Joshua's place, ABC News reports. Before his date could enter his home, Joshua asked the girl to wait until he had secured Texas outside.
The Perth Magistrates Court was told that the woman put her hand out to Texas "to sniff" but it jumped and bit her on the face.
As per prosecutor Tim Houweling, a "chunk" was bitten off from the woman's face and the lady was left with a "hole". For that, she had to undergo plastic surgery and required 21 stitches.
As per the report published in ABC News, Tim Houweling also said that Texas was unregistered and Joshua Walker had not provided the dog's microchip details to his local council.
Owing to the dangerous attack by the dog on the woman, the council was "seeking to have the dog destroyed to ensure it was removed from the community."
Joshua Walker has accepted almost every other fact of the case, his lawyer Alex Smith said. However, Joshua did not agree with the fact that the woman was bitten after his date put her hand out to Texas. Instead, Joshua said that "You had lent over the dog."
